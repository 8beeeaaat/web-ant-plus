# web-ant-plus

A package for ANT+ on Web browsers.

[![demo clip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4495546/205473639-220061d6-4f0d-4929-9890-2f3dc28af2c7.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XKP9zcMnw8)

This repository was based on [ant-plus the original module for Node.js](https://github.com/Loghorn/ant-plus) by [@Loghorn](https://github.com/Loghorn).

üìù This package uses the [WebUSB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebUSB_API). This API is [not available in some browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB#browser_compatibility).

## How to use

```sh
npm install web-ant-plus
```

### Create USB stick

There are several ways to create a USB stick that can be used to start/create a sensor:

#### Create a specific USB stick GarminStick2 or GarminStick3

```typescript
import { GarminStick3 } from "web-ant-plus";
const stick = new GarminStick3();
```

#### Create USB stick from a new pairing

This method will create a USBDriver (`stick`) from an ANT+ USB stick that has already been paired (i.e. will not open the dialog but rather filter for already paired usb devices). Please note that if more than one ANT+ stick was paired it will chose the first one.

```typescript
const stick = USBDriver.createFromPairedDevice();
```

#### Create USB stick from a specific USBDevice instance

This method will create a USBDriver (`stick`) from a USBDevice instance. Please note that this does not do any checks whether USBDevice instance is in fact an ANT+ stick.

```typescript
const stick = USBDriver.createFromDevice();
```

#### Create USB stick from an already paired device

This method will open a prompt to pair a usb device to connect to. Once connected it will return a USBDriver instance (`stick`)

```typescript
const stick = USBDriver.createFromNewDevice();
```

### Create sensors

```typescript
const hrSensor = new HeartRateSensor(stick);
```

#### Attach events

```typescript
hrSensor.on("hbData", function (data: HeartRateSensorState) {
  console.log(data.DeviceID, data.ComputedHeartRate);
});

stick.on("startup", function () {
  hrSensor.attach(0, 0);
});
```

#### Open stick

```typescript
await stick.open();
```

Please note that the `open()` method will resolve the promise only once the stick is closed (or rejected due to an error). In this case it will return the underlying USBDevice instance. In practice this should mean that the `open()` method, if awaited, is blocking until the communication with stick terminates.

### scanning

```typescript
const hrScanner = new HeartRateScanner(stick);

hrScanner.on("hbData", function (data: HeartRateSensorState) {
  console.log(data.DeviceID, data.ComputedHeartRate);
});

stick.on("startup", function () {
  hrScanner.scan();
});

if (!stick.open()) {
  console.log("Stick not found!");
}
```

## Important notes

- never attach a sensor before receiving the startup event
- never attach a new sensor before receiving the attached or detached event of the previous sensor
- never detach a sensor before receiving the attached or detached event of the previous sensor

## Objects

### GarminStick2 and GarminStick3

GarminStick2 is the driver for ANT+ sticks with a USB product ID of `0x1008`.
As well as the old Garmin USB2 ANT+ stick, this works with many of the common off-brand clones.

GarminStick3 is the driver for the mini Garmin ANT+ stick
which has a USB product ID of `0x1009`.

#### properties

- maxChannels

  - The maximum number of channels that this stick supports; valid only after startup event fired.

#### methods

- is_present()

  - Checks if the stick is present. Returns true if it is, false otherwise.

- open()

  - Tries to open the stick. Returns a promise that resolves once the stick is closed (or the promise is rejected due to an error). In this case it will return the underlying USBDevice instance. In practice this should mean that the `open()` method if awaited is blocking until the communication with stick terminates.

- close()

  - Closes the stick.

- reset()

  - Reset the stick and detach all sensors;

#### events

- startup

  - Fired after the stick is correctly initialized.

- shutdown

  - Fired after the stick is correctly closed.

### Common to all Sensors

#### Sensors methods

- attach(channel: number, deviceID: number)

  - Attaches the sensors, using the specified channel and deviceId (use 0 to connect to the first device found).

- detach()

  - Detaches the sensor.

#### Sensors events

- attached

  - Fired after the sensor is correctly attached.

- detached

  - Fired after the sensor is correctly detached.

### Common to all Scanners

#### Scanners methods

- scan()

  - Attaches the sensors and starts scanning for data from every devices in range.

- detach()

  - Detaches the sensor.

#### Scanners events

- attached

  - Fired after the sensor is correctly attached.

- detached

  - Fired after the sensor is correctly detached.

### HeartRate

#### HeartRate events

- hbData

  - Fired when new heartbeat data is received.

### SpeedCadence

#### SpeedCadence methods

#### setWheelCircumference(circumferenceInMeters)

Calibrates the speed sensor. Defaults to a wheel with diameter of 70cm (= 2.199).

#### SpeedCadence events

- speedData

  - Fired when a new wheel speed is calculated.

- cadenceData

  - Fired when a new pedal cadence is calculated.

### StrideSpeedDistance

#### StrideSpeedDistance events

- ssdData

  - Fired when new data been calculated.

### BicyclePower

#### BicyclePower events

- powerData

  - Fired when new power has been calculated.

### FitnessEquipment

#### FitnessEquipment events

- fitnessData

  - Fired when new data is received.

### Environment

#### Environment events

- envData

  - Fired when data is received.
  - The `state.EventCount` value can be used to tell when a new measurement has been made by the sensor -
    it's value will have been incremented.
